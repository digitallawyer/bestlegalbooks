Roy Black is a partner with Black, Srebnick, Kornspan & Stumpf in Miami. Known for representing high-profile clients, including William Kennedy Smith and Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis, Black recently had cameo appearances on Bravo TV’s Real Housewives of Miami, which featured his wife, Lea, as a cast member.

“In college I read Louis Nizer’s legal memoir My Life in Court. I walked along with him into those old courtrooms and watched him perform, mesmerized by his brilliant and fluent advocacy. Long before I turned the last page, I desperately wanted to follow his path. His true stories make the Grisham and Turow legal thrillers pale and bloodless by comparison.”
