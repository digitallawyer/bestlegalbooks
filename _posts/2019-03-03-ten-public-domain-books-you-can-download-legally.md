John Ray Grisham Jr. is an American novelist, attorney, politician, and activist, best known for his popular legal thrillers. His books have been translated into 42 languages and published worldwide. We rank the ten best John Grisham novels off all time:

**#10. [The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (2006)](/the-innocent-man-murder-and-injustice-in-a-small-town/)** — The only work of non-fiction in Grisham’s bibliography, The Innocent Man deals with one of Grisham’s passions: wrongful convictions.

**#9. The Brethren (2000)** — Focusing on three judges that scam married men that are in the closet looking for gay pen pals, as well as a presidential campaign, The Brethren has a smart premise. Though some of the characters come off as flat, it’s still clever and intriguing, with some truly hilarious moments sprinkled throughout. This is one that has gotten a bit better with age.

8
The Racketeer (2012) — The Racketeer was released on October 23, 2012 by Doubleday with an initial printing of 1.5 million copies. It was one of the best selling books of 2012 and spent several weeks atop various best seller lists. The novel follows protagonist Malcolm Bannister, an African American and former United States Marine, who is an attorney in a modest Virginia small-town law firm.

The Street Lawyer (1998) – The story of a young, affluent lawyer that gives up the big firm to help those in need is a recurring theme in Grisham’s works, but it is best delivered in The Street Lawyer. When a homeless man takes a group of lawyers hostage for seemingly no reason, the main character begins to ask why it happened and winds up questioning his entire life and career. This was the first of many Grisham novels in which he tries to teach a message, but it’s done a bit more subtly and doesn’t deter from the story.

6
The Testament (1999) — Another great Grisham opening. The Testament begins in the first-person of a dying billionaire, but switches to a third-person narrative beginning with chapter three. A dual plot of a lawyer searching for a missionary in Brazil while a group of heirs challenge a will back home with clever plot twists and a somewhat surprising ending, it is also a veiled personal commentary from Grisham on society’s view on wealth and how others perceive those with money (like himself).

5
A Painted House (2001) – For a writer known for plot and pacing, Grisham takes his time with A Painted House. His first non-legal book and inspired by his childhood, he paints a vivid portrait of a young boy growing up on an Arkansas farm in 1952 in rich detail, giving much more time to his characters than he usually does, resulting in a fine coming of age story.

4
The Rainmaker (1995) – While it once again features the favorite Grisham trope of the idealistic little guy fighting an evil corporation, The Rainmaker eschews the formula by following the exploits of a recent, non-exceptional graduate that struggles to find a job rather than an Ivy League overachiever at a big firm. Grisham seamlessly blends the law, humor, love, optimism, despair, and post-college angst into a single narrative that balances its idealism with just enough reality, resulting in my personal favorite Grisham work.

3
A Time to Kill (1989) – I originally had A Time to Kill ranked at number one, just because it was the one that started it all and tackles some difficult subject matter, but it has too many flaws to be worthy of the top spot. It begins with a chilling opening and doesn’t stop until the final page, but it rambles at times and gets in its own way once or twice. Plus, the n-word is used abundantly, something that becomes more startling with each passing year (and something he would avoid in later works). Still, the story of Jake Brigance and his ragtag group of allies taking on the KKK and the National Guard and the justice system is both inspired and inspiring and would be the book by which all other Grisham novels are measured.

2
The Last Juror (2004) – The best of both Grishams, The Last Juror mixes courtroom drama and small town lawyers with typical Southern living and one man’s maturity into adulthood in the 1970s. A prequel of sorts that is told in the first-person, it is set several years before the events of A Time to Kill and features both Lucien Wilbanks and Harry Rex Vonner, the best characters from Kill, as well as my favorite Grisham protagonist, Willie Traynor. Written nearly twenty years after his first book, the change in Grisham’s sensibilities is clear so in Grisham chronology, the outward racism in Clanton gets worse as time goes on.

1. **[The Partner (1997)](https://www.google.com)** – A Mississippi lawyer fakes his death, steals $90 million, and flees to Brazil, only to be found four years later and brought home, but not without secrets and plans of his own.
