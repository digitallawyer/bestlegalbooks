John Ray Grisham Jr. is an American novelist, attorney, politician, and activist, best known for his popular legal thrillers. His books have been translated into 42 languages and published worldwide. We rank the ten best John Grisham novels off all time:

**#10. [The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (2006)](/the-innocent-man-murder-and-injustice-in-a-small-town/)** — The only work of non-fiction in Grisham’s bibliography, The Innocent Man deals with one of Grisham’s passions: wrongful convictions.

**#9. [The Brethren (2000)](/the-brethren/)** — The Brethren covers three judges that scam married men that are in the closet looking for gay pen pals, as well as a presidential campaign. 

**#8. [The Racketeer (2012)](/the-racketeer/)** — The Racketeer was one of the best selling books of 2012 and spent several weeks atop various best seller lists. The novel follows protagonist Malcolm Bannister, an African American and former United States Marine, who is an attorney in a modest Virginia small-town law firm.

**#7. [The Street Lawyer (1998)](/the-street-lawyer/)** – When a homeless man takes a group of lawyers hostage for seemingly no reason, the main character begins to ask why it happened and winds up questioning his entire life and career. 

**#6. [The Testament (1999)](/the-testament/)** – The Testament features a dual plot of a lawyer searching for a missionary in Brazil while a group of heirs challenge a will back home with clever plot twists and a somewhat surprising ending. 

**#5. [A Painted House (2001)](/a-painted-house/)** – A Painted House is Grisham's first non-legal book. Inspired by his childhood, he paints a vivid portrait of a young boy growing up on an Arkansas farm in 1952.

**#4. [The Rainmaker (1995)](/the-rainmaker/)** – It's summer in Memphis. The sweat is sticking to Rudy Baylor's shirt and creditors are nipping at his heels.  Once he had aspirations of breezing through law school and punching his ticket to the good life.  Now he doesn't have a job or a prayer... except for one: an insurance dispute that leaves a family devastated and opens the door for a lawsuit, if Rudy can find a way to file it.


**#3. [A Time to Kill (1989)](/a-time-to-kill/)** – The life of a ten-year-old girl is shattered by two drunken and remorseless young men. The mostly white town of Clanton in Ford County, Mississippi, reacts with shock and horror at the inhuman crime. Until her black father acquires an assault rifle and takes justice into his own outraged hands.

**#2. [The Last Juror (2004)](/the-last-juror/)** – The Last Juror mixes courtroom drama and small town lawyers with typical Southern living and one man’s maturity into adulthood in the 1970s.

**#1. [The Partner (1997)](/the-partner/)** – A Mississippi lawyer fakes his death, steals $90 million, and flees to Brazil, only to be found four years later and brought home, but not without secrets and plans of his own.
